# Intermediate evaluation exercise Adalab

## Project description.

In this exercise we have developed a small web program in which users can play a game of guessing a secret number.
For this we have used HTML5 markup language, to which we have applied some styles with CSS3 and we have developed the functionality through JavaScript, using arrow functions, conditionals, events and their corresponding handler functions (and therefore callbacks).
